= Philips Hue Library for ESP8266 =

This library is designed to access and control Philips Hue Lights Directly with an ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.

To use:

  1. Download ZIP
  
  2. In Arduino IDE from the menu Sketch->Include Library->Add .ZIP Library...
  
  3. Browse to the .zip file and install
  
  4. Library will show up under Include Library
  
  5. Examples are in File->Examples->ESP_Hue
  
Available Class Methods:

	void setAPIKey(const char* APIKey);
		
	void setHubIP(const char* host);
		
	void setHubPort(uint8_t port);
		
	String getLightInfo(int lightNum);  								// Gets the light raw http request data
	
	int getLightState(int lightNum);									// Gets Light State On, or Off
	
	void setLight(int lightNum, int state, int sat, int bri, int hue);  // Set Light State, Saturation, Brightness, and Hue
	
	void setLight(int lightNum, int state, int sat, int bri, int hue, unsigned int trans);  // Set Light State, Saturation, Brightness, and Hue, with transition speed
	
	void setLightPower(int lightNum, int state);						// Set Light Power On, or Off

	String getGroupInfo(int groupNum);									// Gets the group raw http request data

	int getGroupState(int groupNum);									// Gets Group State On, or Off

	void setGroup(int groupNum, int state, int sat, int bri, int hue);  // Set Group State, Saturation, Brightness, and Hue
	
	void setGroup(int groupNum, int state, int sat, int bri, int hue, unsigned int trans);  // Set Group State, Saturation, Brightness, and Hue, with transition speed

	void setGroupPower(int groupNum, int state);	                 	// Set Group Power On, or Off
